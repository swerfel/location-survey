# location-survey

## Description
This is a quick and dirty website where visitors can show where they are from or where they are right now. (especially interesting for bigger online events to get visitors distribution)

## Limitations
Because it should only provide a hotspot like view where the people are, it has no failsafe logic to avoid multiple submission of a user etc.

## Localization
To use in at an english spoken online event, it was translated (english html file). But due to lack of time, the duplicated code was not extracted or the main html file was not extended mit correct localization.
